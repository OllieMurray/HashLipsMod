# HashLips Art Engine 🔥

![](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine/blob/main/banner.png)

Create generative art by using the canvas api and node js. Before you use the generation engine, make sure you have node.js and yarn installed.

## Installation 🛠️

If you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code on the release page and skip this step.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine.git
```

Go to the root of your folder and run this command if you have yarn installed.

```sh
yarn add all
```

Alternatively you can run this command if you have node installed.

```sh
npm install
```
##
many files removed and generating code modified for another project.   Current version here will likely stand up - just including on GIT to sample DEV work
